    <h1>Manual installation tutorial</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Before resorting to this method please try installing Curseforge, Modrinth, or another installer first. This
            should only be used if you are having issues using a launcher. The <a
                href="https://docs.fabricmc.net/players/installing-fabric">fabric docs</a> have more information if you
            experience any issues.
        <p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>To manually install the modpack you'll need to download the <a
                href="https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/">Fabric Installer</a> for your operating system and run it.
            You should see the window below. Set <q>Minecraft Version</q> to <q>1.21</q>
            and <q>Loader Version</q> to <q>0.16.0</q> as shown below.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>The path should already be selected for you. You'll need this for later. (Consider copying it, taking a screeshot, etc.) Complete the installation and restart
            your
            minecraft launcher. The Fabric version should be available in your launcher. Launch the game, wait for it to load completely, then close it. This generates all the folders you'll need. Go to the file path we saved earlier. Locate
            your
            <q>mods</q> folder. It is usually in either your <q>.minecraft</q> folder or the installation folder. Copy
            the files from <q>mods.zip</q> (Downloaded from <a href="caphos-download/">Caphos Downloads</a>) into this folder. Your mods folder should look similar to the image below:
        </p>

    <div>
        <p>Congradulations! You have completed all the necessary setup to run the modpack. I recommend adding the
            resourcepacks and shaderpacks to have the full experience, however they aren't required. You can find their
            folders in the same directory that the mods folder is in. If you have any trouble with this feel free
            to contact a staff member for assistance.</p>
